# WordBatchHighlightApp

This Windows app coded in Python with Tkinter allows the user to specify a folder of Word documents to check if they contain words that the user specifies. If the documents contain any of the words, then they are copied to a specified output folder, the words are highlighted on the copied documents, and a CSV file is output showing how words were highlighted in each document.
